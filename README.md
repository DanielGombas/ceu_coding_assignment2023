# Source for Python data: https://osf.io/svhkx
# Source for Stata data: https://osf.io/2axk3

# The original data files are manually downloaded and saved in the right folders (Python: python_data; Stata: stata_data/raw)

	# original data files must be named 'airbnb_london_listing.csv' (Python); 'food-health.csv' (Stata), see GitHub repo

# In order to run the scripts, these data files have to be downloaded saved to the respective folders

# Folder structure should also be the same as on GitHub:

	# for Python, 'python_code', 'python_data' and 'python_output' should all be set up in the same folder prior to running the code, and 	the script runs from 'python_code/'

	# for Stata, 'stata_code', 'stata_data' and 'stata_figure' should all be set up in the same folder prior to running code, and the 	main.do script runs from 'stata_code/'
		
		# 'stata_data' should contain two subfolders 'raw' and 'derived'. The original data file should be saved in 'raw'.

# Other details are in the commits and comments of the script
